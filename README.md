#Reddit Browser with Node.js and Twilio

This is the example code for a SMS app that allows you to text a phone number and see a list of top posts on Reddit!

Try texting something to (206) 456-6132 to test it out!

##Tutorial

I've written a tutorial on how to build this SMS app. It uses the following technologies:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) -- a method of using the Javascript programming language to create a network application. We're going to use this to build the bulk of the app. 
* [Twilio](http://twilio.com/) -- an API that allows you to interact with phones with web-based development tools. We're going to use this API to power communication between your phone and your code. 
* [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) -- a fast and easy way to host web apps. 

It's a great tutorial for beginning programmers that have a basic understanding of C-style programming syntax, and the command line. 

Because it's very short (20 lines of code) yet does quite a bit, it's something that will pique the interest of beginners!
