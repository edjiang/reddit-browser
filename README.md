#Reddit Browser with Node.js and Twilio

This is the example code for a SMS app that allows you to text a phone number and see a list of top posts on Reddit!

Try texting something to (206) 456-6132 to test it out! You will probably have to text it twice, because it's hosted on Heroku's free tier (and won't respond to the first text in time for Twilio to send you a response). 

##Tutorial

I've written a tutorial on how to build this SMS app. It uses the following technologies:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) -- a method of using the Javascript programming language to create a network application. We're going to use this to build the bulk of the app. 
* [Twilio](http://twilio.com/) -- an API that allows you to interact with phones with web-based development tools. We're going to use this API to power communication between your phone and your code. 
* [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) -- a fast and easy way to host web apps. 

It's a great tutorial for beginning programmers that have a basic understanding of C-style programming syntax, and the command line. 

Because it's very short (20 lines of code) yet does quite a bit, it's something that will pique the interest of beginners!
